**2. Dangerous Individuals and Organizations** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow any organizations 

or individuals that are engaged in the following to have a presence on Facebook: 

Terrorist activity 

Organized hate 

Mass or serial murder 

Human trafficking

We also remove content that expresses support or praise for groups, leaders, or 

individuals involved in these activities. 

 

**3. Promoting and Publicizing Crime** 

**+** 

**4. Coordinating Harm****1****2** 

**I. Violence and Criminal Behavior** 

 

Policy Rationale 

In an effort to prevent and disrupt offline harm and copycat behavior, we prohibit 

people from facilitating, organizing, promoting, or admitting to certain criminal or 

harmful activities targeted at people, businesses, property or animals. We allow 

people to debate and advocate for the legality of criminal and harmful activities, as 

well as draw attention to harmful or criminal activity that they may witness or 

experience as long as they do not advocate for or coordinate harm. 

Do not post content that falls into the following categories: 

 

Harm against people 

 

1 Note added by the Platform Governance Archives: From April 2018 to 30 

November 2019, sections 3 (“Promoting and Publicizing Crime”) and 4 

(“Coordinating Harm”) appeared to exist separately. However, on 30 November 

2019, Facebook merged them (see Facebook original note below). Facebook’s 

records left no trace of what exactly these two sections contained between April 

2018 and 30 November 2019. The Platform Governance Archives decided to use the 

November 2019 text retro-actively, that is, as if it was the text from April 2018 to 30 

November 2019. This is because we understand that having some record of these 

sections was better than having none, even if inaccurate. Readers should remember 

that this is only an approximation of these sections original text between April 2018 

and 30 November 2019 and, as such, should not be understood as the actual policy 

that was in place in that time period. 

 

2 Note from Facebook’s records, 30 November 2019: “Previously, our Community 

Standards included separate sections for Coordinating Harm and Promoting and 

Publicizing Crime. The sections overlapped, which created confusion for our content 

reviewers. As a result, we decided to merge the two sections and more clearly 

delineate the type of harm that we aim to prevent and disrupt - harm against people, 

animals, and property, as well as voter and census interference”.

**9. Bullying****3** 

 

3 Note added by the Platform Governance Archives: From April 2018 to 26 April 

2019, sections 9 (“Bullying”) and 10 (“Harassment”) appeared to exist separately, as 

in this document. Facebook’s records from 26 April 2019 contain the text of these 

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

Bullying happens in many places and comes in many different forms from making 

statements degrading someone&aposs character to posting inappropriate images to 

threatening someone. We do not tolerate bullying on Facebook because we want the 

members of our community to feel safe and respected. 

We will remove content that purposefully targets private individuals with the intention 

of degrading or shaming them. We recognize that bullying can be especially harmful 

to minors, and our policies provide heightened protection for minors because they 

are more vulnerable and susceptible to online bullying. In certain instances, we 

require the individual who is the target of bullying to report content to us before 

removing it. 

Our bullying policies do not apply to public figures because we want to allow 

discourse, which often includes critical discussion of people who are featured in the 

news or who have a large public audience. Discussion of public figures nonetheless 

must comply with our Community Standards, and we will remove content about 

public figures that violates other policies, including hate speech or credible threats. 

Our Bullying Prevention Hub is a resource for teens, parents, and educators seeking 

support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It offers step-by-step 

guidance, including on how to start important conversations for people being bullied, 

parents who have a child being bullied or accused of bullying, and educators who 

have students involved with bullying. 

Do not post: 

 

Content about another private individual that reflects 

 

Claims about sexual activity 

High-severity physical descriptions 

 

Ranking individuals on physical appearance or personality 

Threats of non-consensual sexual touching 

Sexualized text targeting another individual 

Attacks through derogatory terms related to sexual activity (e.g. whore, slut)4 

An individual in a context that is intended to degrade, for example, 

menstruating, urinating, vomiting, or defecating 

Physical bullying where the context further degrades the individual 

Comparison to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or 

physically inferior or to an inanimate object

between April 2018 and 26 April 2019. 

4 Note from Facebook’s records, 26 April 2019: “Updated November 2018.”

Content that specifies an individual as the target of 

Statements of intent to commit violence

than the person referenced and targets more than one individual

Coordinating, advocating, or promoting exclusion 

Negative character claims 

Expressions of contempt or disgust 

Calls for death or serious disease or disability

with no caption or a neutral or praising caption 

 

 

In some cases, content is written in the first person but is actually posted by a 

different individual than the person referenced in the content. This may be done to 

target the person in the content with the intention of degrading or shaming them. We 

remove: 

 

 

Content that contains the following and is reported by the individual depicted: 

 

Claims about sexual activity 

Comparisons to animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or 

physically inferior or to an inanimate object 

Degrading physical descriptions

content may be disturbing:

condemning caption 

 

 

**10. Harassment** 

 

**II. Safety** 

 

Policy Rationale 

 

We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook. We want people to feel safe to engage 

and connect with their community. Our harassment policy applies to both public and 

private individuals because we want to prevent unwanted or malicious contact on the 

platform. Context and intent matter, and we allow people to share and re-share posts 

if it is clear that something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to 

harassment. In addition to reporting such behavior and content, we encourage 

people to use tools available on Facebook to help protect against it.

7 Note added by the Platform Governance Archives: In Facebook’s records, the 

changes in this provision appear as made on 30 November 2018. However, the

**12. Hate Speech** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale 

We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected 

characteristics — race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste sexual 

orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We also 

provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or 

dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion or 

segregation. Attacks are separated into three tiers of severity, described below. 

Do not post: 

**Tier 1** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share one of the above-

listed characteristics or immigration status (including all subsets except those 

described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses), where attack is 

defined as 

Any violent speech or support in written or visual form 

 

Dehumanizing speech such as reference or comparison to: 

 

Insects 

Animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically 

inferior 

Filth, bacteria, disease and feces 

Sexual predator 

Subhumanity 

Violent and sexual criminals 

Other criminals (including but not limited to “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or 

saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] 

are ‘criminals’”) 

 

Mocking the concept, events or victims of hate crimes even if no real person 

is depicted in an image 

Designated dehumanizing comparisons in both written and visual form 

**Tier 2** attacks, which target a person or group of people who share any of the above-

listed characteristics, where attack is defined as 

Statements of inferiority or an image implying a person&aposs or a group&aposs physical, 

mental, or moral deficiency 

Physical (including but not limited to “deformed,” “undeveloped,” 

“hideous,” “ugly”) 

Mental (including but not limited to “retarded,” “cretin,” “low IQ,” 

“stupid,” “idiot”) 

Moral (including but not limited to “slutty,” “fraud,” “cheap,” “free riders”) 

Expressions of contempt or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited 

to) 

"I hate" 

"I don&apost like" 

"X are the worst" 

Expressions of disgust or their visual equivalent, including (but not limited to) 

"Gross" 

"Vile" 

"Disgusting" 

Cursing at a person or group of people who share protected 

characteristics 

**Tier 3** attacks, which are calls to exclude or segregate a person or group of people 

based on the above-listed characteristics. We do allow criticism of immigration 

policies and arguments for restricting those policies. 

**Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs**, where slurs are 

defined as words commonly used as insulting labels for the above-listed 

characteristics. 

**13. Violent and GraphicContent** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

Policy Rationale8 

 

We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of 

others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We 

allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about 

issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human 

rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different 

sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a 

warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available to 

 

8 Note added by the Platform Governance Archives: The first time this “Policy 

Rationale” appears in Facebook’s records is 30 November 2018. Yet, the records do 

not mark them as new (i.e., highlighted in green). It is therefore possible that this 

excerpt had been in place before 30 November 2018.

**15. Sexual Solicitation** 

**III. Objectionable Content** 

 

Policy Rationale 

As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Sexual Exploitation of Adults), 

people use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and 

exploitation. We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. 

We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates 

sexual encounters between adults. We also restrict sexually explicit language that 

may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may 

be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to 

connect with their friends and the broader community. 

Do not post: 

Content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities including but 

not limited to: 

Filmed sexual activities 

Pornographic activities, strip club shows, live sex performances, erotic dances 

Sexual, erotic, or tantric massages 

 

Content that engages in explicit sexual solicitation by, including but not limited to the 

following, offering or asking for: 

 

Sex or sexual partners 

Sex chat or conversations 

Nude images 

 

Content that engages in implicit sexual solicitation, which can be identified by 

mentioning a sexual act and other suggestive elements such as any of the following: 

 

Vague suggestive statements, such as “looking for a good time tonight” 

Sexualized slang 

Using sexual hints such as mentioning sexual roles, sex positions, fetish 

scenarios, sexual preference/sexual partner preference, state of arousal, act 

of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), 

commonly sexualized areas of the body such as the breasts, groin, or 

buttocks, state of hygiene of genitalia or buttocks 

Content (hand drawn, digital, or real-world art) that may depict explicit sexual 

activity or suggestively posed person(s) 

 

Content that offers or asks for other adult activities such as: 

 

Commercial pornography 

Partners who share fetish or sexual interests 

 

Sexually explicit language that adds details and goes beyond mere naming or 

mentioning of: 

 

A state of sexual arousal (wetness or erection) 

An act of sexual intercourse (sexual penetration, self-pleasuring or exercising 

fetish scenarios) 

**16. Cruel and Insensitive**

death, serious or fatal disease or disability, non-consensual sexual touching, or 

serious physical injury 

**17. Spam** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

 

Policy Rationale 

We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, 

fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people&aposs ability to share and 

connect. We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to 

collect likes, followers, or shares. 

Do not:

Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to

private individual 

Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people

before viewing

9 Note added by the Platform Governance Archives: Per Facebook’s records, the 

first change to this section happens occurred in July 2019. However, merely 

subtracting the new content added in July 2019 leaves this excerpt truncated. 

Therefore, the expression “makes fun of” was added by us as attempt to reconstruct 

what was the likely meaning of the text before July 2019.

Using a name that does not abide by our name policies 

Providing a false date of birth

under the Community Standards. 

 

**19. False news** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

Policy rationale 

 

Reducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take 

seriously. We also recognise that this is a challenging and sensitive issue. We want 

to help people stay informed without stifling productive public discourse. There is 

also a fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we 

don&apost remove false news from Facebook, but instead significantly reduce its 

distribution by showing it lower in the News Feed. Learn more about our work to 

reduce the spread of false news here. 

 

We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false 

news in a number of different ways, namely by 

 

Disrupting economic incentives for people, Pages and domains that 

propagate misinformation 

Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a 

machine learning model that predicts which stories may be false 

Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party 

fact-checkers 

Empowering people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share by 

informing them with more context and promoting news literacy 

Collaborating with academics and other organisations to help solve this 

challenging issue 

 

**20. Memorialization** 

**IV. Integrity and Authenticity** 

When we learn that someone has passed away, we memorialize the account by 

adding "Remembering" above the name on the person&aposs profile. This makes it clear 

that the account is now a memorial site and protects against attempted logins and 

fraudulent activity. We do not remove, update, or change anything about the profile 

or the account because we want to respect the choices someone made while still 

alive. We have also made it possible for people to identify a legacy contact to look 

after their account after they pass away. People can let us know in advance if they 

want their account permanently deleted when they die. We may delete profiles when 

the next of kin tells us that the person who passed would have preferred that we 

delete the account rather than memorialize it. Visit Hard Questions for more 

information about our memorialization policy and process.
